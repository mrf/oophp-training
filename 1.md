##Lesson 1: Plain Objects

###New keywords and operators:
 - `new`
 - `stdClass`
 - `->`

Most of you have probably dealt with objects before, so here's a little
refresher on PHP objects and syntax.

PHP doesn't support object literals, so we create a new object using the following
syntax:

`$person = new stdClass();`

We can assign properties to the object using the *object operator*, `->` The
object operator is also used to access object properties.

```php
<?php

$person->name = 'Alice';
echo $person->name;
// => 'Alice'
```

Those properties can also be functions. Functions assigned to object properties
are known as *methods*.

`$person->talk = function () { echo 'hi'; };`

Object properties can be deleted by invoking the unset() function.

`unset($person->name);`

Objects are always passed by reference, meaning that a function that accepts an
object as a parameter modifies the original object passed to it, rather than
making a copy of it.

```php
<?php

function set_name($object, $name) {
  $object->name = $name;
}

$person = new stdClass();
set_name($person, 'Alice');
echo $person->name;
// => 'Alice'
```

The use of plain objects in PHP is fairly inflexible without using classes, lets explore!

###Exercises:

 - Write a function Person() that returns a new stdClass() object containing:

  - A name property
  - A talk method that simply echos 'hi'

 - Assign the return value of `Person()` to a `$person` variable
 - Echo the name property of the returned object.
 - Invoke `var_dump()` on the object.
 - Invoke the talk method by calling `call_user_func()` on the method.
